Roth 403b Plans
Included in the Bush Administrations Fiscal Year 2006 Budget were some changes to the way you can fund your 403b plan - the new Roth 403b.  In this publication we're going to discuss the benefits of a Roth 403b along with the rules of these plans including withdrawals / distributions, contributions, and income taxes.
Background of the Roth 403b
Starting in January 2006, operators of traditional 403b plans can offer their employees what's being called a Roth 403b plan.  In essence, offering "Roth" treatment of funds going into a 403b account.

Roth IRA versus 403b Plan
A Roth 403b combines the contribution features of 403b plans with the tax-free growth advantage of Roth IRAs .  Employees currently offered the ability to fund their retirement plans via 403b plans may now be offered the option of participating in a Roth 403b.  With this new plan, you'll never have to pay federal income taxes on the growth portion of your account, or your contributions, when you withdraw the money.
Roth 403b Fund Requirements
There are very few requirements of these new Roth 403b plans.  Employers have the opportunity to consolidate a variety of retirement funds into what are called Employer Retirement Savings Accounts, or ERSAs.  These ERSAs will be available to all employers that meet some pretty simple qualifications.
As previously mentioned, the proposal becomes effective for the years beginning after December 31, 2005.  In most situations, that translated into January 1, 2006.  Retirement money placed into a Roth 403b has to be kept in an account that is separate from other funding.  That's about it as far as employers are concerned.
Benefits of Roth 403b Plans
Many employees already participating in a 403b plan at work will be offered the opportunity to participate in Roth 403b.  For those people, the question they are going to be asking themselves is simply this:  "Should I fund a Roth 403b or stick with my existing 403b plan?"
The answer to that question has to do with each plan's income tax treatment of contributions and withdrawals and what they believe their income tax bracket will be in retirement.  By making before before-tax contributions to your traditional 403b plan, you're reducing your current tax liability.  With Roth 403b contributions, you'll be making after-tax contributions:
While before-tax contributions act to reduce your taxable income today, you're going to pay income taxes on the contributions and earnings when they're distributed to you at retirement.
Roth 403b contributions won't reduce your taxable income right now.  But these contributions, and the earnings on them, are tax-free at retirement - as long as you're at least age 591/2 and your Roth 403b account is at least five years old.
So if you believe you're in a higher tax bracket today than you will be in retirement, then sticking with a 403b plan might be your best move.  If you think your tax bracket will stay the same or increase in your retirement years, then a Roth 403b is probably your best move.
Roth Treatment of 403b Contributions
The key here is that plan administrators can elect to make available to their employees Roth treatment of contributions to retirement savings plans such as a 403b plan.  The intention of the proposed change would be to help consolidate all of the retirement accounts that permit employees to make after-tax contributions to a retirement savings account.
Roth 403b Contribution Limits
ESRAs need to follow the rules previously outlined for 401k plans with additional simplifications - we've already talked about 401k contribution rules  in a previous article.  Employees can defer or contribute up to $15,500 in wages annually in 2008, and $16,500 in 2009.  And like other retirement plans, there is an additional catch-up contribution of $5,000 for employees 50 and older in 2008, and $5,500 in 2009.  The maximum total contribution limit - which also includes employer contributions - is the lesser of $46,000 or 100% of the employee's compensation in 2008.  The maximum total contribution limit in the year 2009 is $49,000.
For information on the contribution limits for the years 2010 and beyond, take a look at our article on 403b Contribution Rules .
Roth 403b Withdrawals and Distributions
Like its predecessors, the Roth 403b was established as a retirement plan.  That means the IRS looks down on early withdrawals that occur before age 59 1/2.  Hardship or other types of withdrawals are subject to the same 403b rules and penalties that are currently on the books.  And the Roth 403b minimum distribution rules are also similar to 403b withdrawals plans - meaning you need to start to take mandatory distributions when you reach age 70 1/2.
Taxes on Roth 403b Distributions and Contributions
The tax liabilities associated with employee contributions and distributions from an ERSA would be the same as the plans that the ESRA is replacing.  That means the employee could fund an ERSA with pre-tax monies, after-tax contributions, or Roth contributions.  The exact type of contribution will depend on the plan's design.
Distributions of Roth 403b (after-tax) contributions, and the earnings of those same contributions, would not be included in income for tax purposes.  Other distributions - such as those made on a before-tax basis - would be included as taxable income. So the rules are similar to those of existing plans, but the introduction of the "Roth" concept and its benefits add to the plan's overall attractiveness as a retirement fund.
Roth 403b Income Tax Rules
The income tax rules for a Roth 403b are fairly easy to remember if you think of the plan using these two rules of thumb:
This type of plan allows you to put money into your account on an after-tax basis - just like a Roth IRA.  And just like a Roth IRA, the distributions from a Roth 403b are free from federal income taxes.
If your employer contributes to your Roth 403b - such as the case when employers match funds - then those contributions have gone into an account on a before-tax basis (you never paid income taxes on your employer's contributions.)  Therefore the portion of your Roth 403b funding that comes from employer contributions is subject to federal income taxes upon withdrawal.
In most cases, an employer's matching contributions to Roth 403b will be placed in a traditional 403b account.

403b Rollover
In general, you can roll-over all or any part of a distribution from a 403b plan to a traditional IRA or an eligible retirement plan without paying any taxes.  The maximum amount eligible for a 403b rollover is the amount that would be taxable.  In other words, if you made an after-tax contribution to your 403b, then you cannot rollover that portion into tax-deferred retirement account.
403b Rollover Rules
If you're thinking about a 403b rollover, then you need to be aware of some of the more important rules - especially if a distribution is made directly to you.  That is to say, if you need to make a 403b rollover, then you might as well do it the correct way - or at least understand what's supposed to happen when you do the rollover.
  Additional Resources
Roth IRA versus 403b Plan
Doing a rollover the wrong way can result in an unnecessary tax penalty, that's why it's so important to follow all the rules the IRS has established.  And the first rule we're going to discuss has to do with what is called the 60-day rule.
Sixty-Day Rollover Rule
Generally, a 403b rollover needs to be completed by the 60th day following the day you've received any distribution.  If you're planning on rolling over the money into another account, then meeting the requirements of this 60-day rule shouldn't be any problem.  If you're planning on holding onto the money for some reason past the 60th day, then you might wind up paying a large tax penalty.
The IRS does allow for two exceptions to the 60-day rule.  The first has to do with unforeseen circumstances or hardships.
Hardship Exception for 403b Rollovers
The IRS can waive the 60-day rollover rule for 403b plans if you can provide evidence that you've experienced some kind of hardship.  The hardship can take a number of forms, but should be beyond the reasonable control of the individual making the rollover such as a hospitalization or some other kind of disaster.
If you're in need of a hardship exemption, you need to apply to the IRS for a waiver of the 60 day rollover requirement .  You'll also be required to pay an application fee of $95.
Keep in mind that exemptions are not granted automatically, the IRS uses some of the following factors to determine whether an exception is granted:
Errors made by financial institutions or banks
Delays were due to postal errors, hospitalization, or disability
Whether or not you used the 403b distribution in any way, including cashing the check itself
The amount of time that has passed since the distribution
The second exception to the 60 day rollover rule has to do with money being frozen in an account.
Frozen Deposit Exception for 403b Rollovers
The 60-day rule for completing a 403b rollover can be extended for any amount of time that the distribution is frozen in a deposit with a bank or financial institution.  In addition, the 60 day period cannot end any earlier than ten days after the account is no longer frozen.
To qualify as a frozen deposit, the account must be with:
A financial institution that is bankrupt or insolvent, or
The state in which the bank is located has placed limits on withdrawals because one or more financial institutions of that state are bankrupt or insolvent.
Rollovers to 403b Plans
If you've received a distribution from another 403b plan , or any other eligible retirement plan, then that money can be rolled-over into a 403b plan on a tax-free basis.  If the distribution contains both pre-tax and after-tax contributions, then the money that is rolled-over is first treated as pre-tax amounts.
This is an important rule to understand.  If you have a mix of pre-tax and after-tax money and only rollover a portion of the distribution, then the money involved in the rollover is treated as the pre-tax portion of the account first.
403b Rollover Example
For example, let's say you decide not to roll over the entire distribution but only an amount equal to the pre-tax dollars.  This rule means you would not have to declare the remaining distribution as income, since you've already paid income tax on this portion of the distribution.
403b Rollovers to 401k Plans
In general, you can rollover a 403b account into most qualified retirement plans.  This includes traditional IRAs , 401k plans , SEP IRA and even a Roth IRA after December 31, 2007 (although you may be required to include some amounts in taxable income).  You cannot rollover a 403b plan into a SIMPLE IRA .
Withholding Rules for 403b Rollovers
There are basically two ways that distributions from a 403b can be made - to you (the individual), or to directly into a another qualifying retirement plan .  If you decide to receive a distribution directly, then there is a withholding rule you need to be aware of.
Distributions to Individuals
When distributions that are qualified to be rolled over are made directly to an individual, you'll typically receive only 80% of the distribution because 20% of the distribution needs to be withheld.  But in order to avoid a tax penalty, you need to rollover the entire amount.
If you decide to have the distribution made to you directly, then in order to rollover 100% of the distribution you will have to make up the 20% that is withheld with other money.  If you cannot make up the 20% that is withheld, then you may have to declare the 20% as income and face additional tax penalties.
After you have satisfactorily rolled over 100% your 403b distribution, the remaining 20% will be released to you.  But because of the withholding rule, most individuals roll over their 403b by making what are called direct rollovers.
Direct Rollovers of 403b Plans
You also have the option of having your 403b plan administrator make the rollover directly to an IRA or your new 403b plan.  This is the most common way to make a rollover because the 20% withholding rule does not apply to direct rollovers.  It's also one of the easiest ways to conduct a rollover since you only need to coordinate the exchange of the distribution.
Unless you have a very good reason for taking possession of the money involved in a 403b rollover, you're best choice is to make a direct, plan-to-plan, deposit.
Non-Qualifying 403b Rollover Distributions
We're going to finish up with a quick list of 403b distributions that do not qualify for a rollover on a tax free basis:
Minimum distributions (which are usually required beginning at age 70 1/2)
Distributions taken in substantially equal payments over your life expectancy
Substantially equal payments taken over the life of a joint beneficiary
Distributions that are taken in substantially equal payments over a period of 10 years or more
Qualifying hardship distributions

403b Loans
Under certain conditions, it is possible to obtain a loan from your 403b plan.  But you've got to work closely with your plan administrator to make sure that the loan isn't viewed as an early distribution.  If a loan is viewed as a distribution, it'll be reported as income, and if you're under age 59 1/2, then you may be subject to a 10% tax penalty.
403b Loan Limitations
If your 403b annuity plan offers this benefit, it is possible to obtain a loan from your 403b account before age 59 1/2 without incurring a penalty.  However, if the provisions of the 403b loan are not adhered to, then the loan may be deemed a distribution.  And if your not age 59 1/2, then additional tax penalties may apply.
  Additional Resources
Roth IRA versus 403b Plan
The following list summarizes the 403b loan rules that you need to follow to stay clear of the early distribution penalties:
First off, your 403b plan, or the tax-sheltered annuity, must provide for loans.  That means your plan must be set up to allow for loans.
The limit on all loans, at any time, cannot exceed $50,000.  This means all loans from this employer cannot exceed $50,000.
Payments on the loan must be made quarterly (at a minimum).  The loan agreement may provide for a three-month grace period, and may also allow a participant to suspend payments during military service.
The term of the 403b loan may not exceed 5 years, unless the money is used for the purchase of a principal residence.
Finally, the loan must bear a reasonable rate of interest.
If you fail to pay an amount due on a loan, or default on the loan, then the IRS will treat the entire distribution (not just the remaining balance) as a distribution.  In that situation, the 10% early withdrawal penalty will apply.
403b Hardship Distributions
It is possible to obtain a hardship distribution from your 403b plan.  Please note, that this is not considered a hardship loan; rather it is considered a distribution.  Hardships must be demonstrated, and result in an "immediate and heavy" financial burden.  Failure to meet these criteria can jeopardize the status of the tax sheltered annuity.
Hardship Distribution Rules
In order to take a 403b hardship distribution, you're probably going to have to prove that you're under severe financial distress and have no other viable resources available to you to deal with that burden.  Examples of allowable hardships include:
Medical Expenses - payment on any un-reimbursed medical expenses of the plan participant, their spouse, and dependents.
Primary Residence - money used as a down payment on a primary residence.
College Expenses - includes tuition and fees associated with post-secondary education expenses for the next 12 months.
Foreclosure - money needed to prevent eviction or foreclosure on your primary residence.
The above types of hardship withdrawals are allowed by an IRS provision that asks employers to provide for a safe harbor withdrawal if there exits an immediate and heavy financial need or burden
Taking a 403b Hardship Withdrawals
Please note that hardship withdrawals are not necessarily exempt from an additional 10% tax penalty.  In addition, withdrawals of this type are subject to federal income tax as they are viewed as ordinary income.
You may also be asked to certify that you have no other way of accommodating this burden - including the possibility of taking a loan (including a 403b loan).  You will also be likely prohibited from contributing to your 403b plan for six months.
Finally, it's not possible to perform a 403b rollover into another retirement plan or IRA with a hardship distribution.
Borrowing from a 403b
Before making any decision to borrow from your 403b - whether it is a loan or hardship distribution - you need to make sure that you've exhausted all other alternatives including taking out a personal loan.  Remember, you're borrowing against your future to pay for expenses today and that's not a good thing.
For example, if you take a 403b loan, then you're going to be prohibited from participating in your plan until all of the money is repaid.  If your employer matches your contributions, then you're missing out on that benefit.  And if you eventually decide you cannot repay the loan then you're going to owe income tax and pay a 10% early withdrawal penalty.
In addition, if you decide to leave your employer before the loan is repaid, then you may be required to immediately repay the entire loan or be faced with tax penalties.  What we're trying to demonstrate is that taking a 403b loan should not be an easy decision.  In fact, it's probably a good idea to consult with a tax professional or lender before taking money out of your 403b.
If you'd like to run through some scenarios using alternative sources of money, to see what your monthly payments might look like, then take a look at our personal loan calculators .
403b Sponsor Rules
Your plan sponsor also has certain responsibilities with respect to 403b loans.  Failure to identify and report loans that do not comply with the above rules may be deemed as a taxable distribution that should be reported to the employee as income.
For example, if an employee has more than $50,000 in outstanding loans with the employer, or fails to make timely payments on a 403b loan, then the plan's sponsor must report the loan as a taxable distribution to the employee.

403b Contribution Rules
In this article, we're going to be discussing 403b contribution rules.  Our discussion is going to include elective deferrals, after-tax contributions, and maximum allowable contributions.  We'll also run through some of the contribution rules that are unique to 403b plans such as the 15-year rule.
There are only two sources of money that can be directed to your 403b account - through a salary reduction agreement, or by an employer making contributions directly to the fund itself.  Even though you might be able to establish the contribution rules for your particular 403b plan, only your employer can make the actual contributions to your 403b account - you cannot make direct deposits into this kind of retirement plan.
Contributions to 403b Accounts
Roth IRA versus 403b Plan
This last point is subtle, but it's also an important one. Unlike a Roth IRA plan, you cannot wake up one day and decide to contribute $3,000 to your 403b.  The money has to come out of your paycheck each week, and your employer is one that establishes your account based on your instructions.
That being said, there are three distinct ways to contribute to a 403b plan plus you can use any combination of the below methods:
Elective Deferrals
Elective deferrals are contributions you make under a salary-reduction agreement.  This agreement allows your employer to withhold money from your paycheck to be contributed to your 403b account.  Elective deferrals are not taxed until withdrawn from the account.
Non-Elective Contributions
Non-elective contributions are employer contributions and do not require a salary-reduction agreement.  These can include matching contributions, discretionary contributions, and even mandatory contributions to the employee's account as part of the overall contribution rules or policies established by the plan.  As was the case with elective deferrals, non-elective contributions are not taxable until withdrawn.
After-Tax Contributions
The final way that contributions can be made to a 403b account is via after-tax contributions.  If your plan allows this type of contribution, these are salary payments taken from your paycheck on an after-tax basis.  You cannot deduct this type of contribution from your federal income taxes , however upon withdrawal the taxed portion of the contribution will not be taxed again (but any appreciation, or growth, of this contribution over time will be taxed).
Annual Contributions to 403b Accounts
There are limits to the contributions you can make to your 403b account each year.  If you contribute too much to your account, then certain tax penalties may apply.  Normally, your program administrator will prevent you from over-funding your account automatically, thereby shielding you from any penalty.
Maximum Allowable Contributions or MAC
In general, you need to take into consideration two components of your maximum allowable contribution, or MAC, to understand what contribution limits may apply in a given year.  Those two components include your limit on annual additions (those you and others make to your account) and your limits on elective deferrals (contributions from your paycheck).
The limit that applies to your individual situation depends on the types of contributions made to you account each year.  In general, the contribution limit to your 403b will be the lesser of your limit on annual additions, or your limit on elective deferrals.
Only Elective Deferrals
If the only contributions made to your 403b were elective deferrals, then you will need to calculate both of the limits mentioned above.  You MAC will be the lower of the two limits calculated.
Only Non-Elective Contributions
If the only contributions made to your 403b account were non-elective contributions (employer contributions to your account), then your MAC will be determined by calculating your limit on annual additions.
Elective and Non-Elective Contributions
If contributions to your 403b account include both elective and non-elective contributions, then you will need to calculate both limits, however, your MAC is the limit on annual additions.
Calculating Your MAC
You should calculate your MAC each year based on your actual compensation.  It is advisable to use a conservative estimate of your compensation when calculating your MAC.  If your compensation should change during the calendar year, you can recalculate your new MAC based on this better information.
Annual Additions
The first component of the MAC calculation is your limit on annual additions.  This is the limits on all contributions to you 403b account and includes:
Elective deferrals
Non-elective contributions
After tax contributions
The limit in 2007 for annual additions was the smaller of $45,000 or 100% of your includable compensation.  In 2008, the limit for annual additions moved to $46,000 or 100% of your includable compensation.  In 2009, the limit was increased to $49,000.  In 2010, this limit will be indexed for inflation and can move up in $1,000 increments.
Elective Deferrals
 The limit on elective deferrals to your 403b was $15,500 in 2007.  In 2008, this contribution limit remained at $15,500.  In 2009, the limit was increased to $16,500.  In 2010, the limit can move up in $500 increments based on a measure of inflation.
There is, however, one exception to this guideline that is known as the 15-Year Rule. 
15-Year Rule
If you have at least 15 years of service, then the limit on your elective deferrals, or contributions, to your 403b is increased by the lower of:
$3,000
$15,500 - reduced by the increases to the limit you were allowed in earlier years because of the 15-year rule.
$5,000 times the number of years of service you have with the organization minus the total elective deferrals made by your employer in earlier years
If you happen to qualify for the 15-year rule, then your elective deferrals under this limit can be as high as $18,500 in 2007 and 2008 - and again, that number should move higher in 2009.
Catch-Up Contributions
Finally, if you reach the age of 50 or older by the end of any calendar year, you may be eligible to make additional catch-up contributions to your 403b account.  You cannot make catch up contributions with after-tax contributions and the maximum catch up contribution you can make in 2007 and 2008 is $5,000, or your includable compensation minus your other elective deferrals for the year.  In 2009, the limit increased to $5,500.
In 2010, the rule for catch-up contributions is similar to the ones mentioned earlier.  Catch-up contributions will be indexed to inflation and can move up in $500 increments.  Keep in mind that catch-up contributions are not used when calculating your MAC.  This means the maximum you are allowed to contribute to your 403b account is your catch-up contribution plus your MAC.

403b vs 401k- How are they the same?
403b retirement plans are identical in most ways to 401k plans. 403b and 401b plans function by offering to manage the retirement plan for its employees. Employees choose to have a percentage of paycheck deducted before taxes and put into their retirement brokerage account. Your company probably will match the amount you put in in some way.  Usually, they will match your 403b or 401k contribution up to a certain percentage.  The money is then invested in mutual funds, annuities, REIT's (real estate trusts), or money markets. The retirement account grows tax-free until the employee the money is taken out for retirement. Starting at 59 1/2, you can start to take out money out of your retirement accounts (there are exception when you can take out money earlier).
403b vs 401k- How are they different?
The major difference is that a 403b retirement plan can only be offered by non-profits like schools, hospitals, universities, charities, and research institutes. Since these types of institutions are non-profit, 403b accounts are unable to accept profit sharing or dividends from the brokerage management company (Like Fidelity). Also, the non-profit organization does not have absolute control of the plan. Its only responsibility is to put employees' payroll deductions into the 403b retirement account.
403b vs 401k- So what's the advantage of a 403b over a 401k?
There are two distinct advantages for non-profit institutions. 403b programs have very easy review and certification process since they are exempt from the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. ERISA says that other tax-deferred accounts get a periodic review called discrimination testing. 403b's don't have to worry about any extra accounting and there is next to no administration costs. These cost-savings are generally passed on to the employees, even though they may not see it.  401k plans can charge administration fees, which affects the costs of all participants.
For the employee, there are two big advantages. Number one, the institution's contribution to the 403b retirement account can be taken out without penalty if it invested in an annuity. Since the non-profit organization that matched  it does not owe taxes (since they are a non-profit), the US government says these contributions are exempt from tax liability. The 2nd advantage is being to leave the account with a former 403b retirement plan. Since there are no administrative costs for the 403b retirement account, institutions will almost always let them leave the account in place after they leave.  This means if you are a teacher who taught at one school and then moved to another, you can keep your 403b retirement plan with them at no additional cost.
So, in most cases, you will be better off with a 403b vs a 401k.  However, this doesn't apply in all cases.  Your 403b retirement plan may offer limited choices to invest and may not match your investing objectives or offer poor funds that underperform the market.  It is always best to sit down with a financial planner or accountant before making any investing decision.

403b Retirement Plans 
Employees of private companies may turn to 401k plans to help build      their retirement nest eggs. But what if you’re a school teacher or if you      work for a tax-exempt organization, like a non-profit, hospital or      library? You may have a pension waiting for you at retirement, but a 403b      retirement plan may help provide additional support to reach your      retirement goals.
Who’s eligible for a 403b plan?
These tax-deferred plans are designed for employees of public schools,      colleges and universities, and churches. Employees of certain tax-exempt,      non-profit organizations, such as charities and some hospitals, also may      participate in a 403b retirement plan.
Why make 403b contributions?
Like its better-known 401k cousin, a 403b retirement plan lets you      put a portion of your salary into an employer-sponsored plan to help you      save for retirement. Some employers may also match your contribution.
You don’t pay taxes on what you contribute or any earnings you may      accumulate until you withdraw the money –– hopefully, when you’re retired      and you may be in a lower tax bracket.
Investment options
With a 403b retirement plan, you can typically invest in fixed annuities , variable      annuities ,or mutual funds .
Seek professional advice
Check with your investment professional to help you choose investments      that best meet your retirement objectives.  Remember that      investing involves market risk, including possible loss of principal, and      there's no guarantee that your investment objectives will be      met. 
403b plan withdrawals
Since 403b plans were created to help you save for retirement, there may      be stiff penalties for withdrawing money early. If you do, you’ll owe:
Income taxes on the total withdrawal
A 10% penalty if you’re younger than 59½
20% federal income tax withholding unless the entire amount is        rolled over to another qualified retirement plan or IRA
Neither Nationwide nor our representatives give legal or tax advice, so      consult your attorney or tax advisor about tax questions.
Take the next step
Enrolling in your employer’s 403b retirement plan is a big step in      preparing for your future. You can even start small − the important thing      is that you start investing      now to give your money time to grow.  
Ask your retirement plan representative how to sign up. If your employer      doesn’t offer a 403b plan, ask if they offer another kind of retirement      plan. Or ask your investment professional about other ways to start investing for      retirement.
Also known as . . .
403b retirement savings plans sometimes go by the names:
TSA (tax-sheltered annuity)
TDA (tax-deferred annuity)
Not a deposit • Not FDIC or NCUSIF insured • Not guaranteed by the      institution • Not insured by any federal government agency • May lose      value
Life insurance and annuities are issued by Nationwide Life Insurance      Company or Nationwide Life and Annuity Insurance Company, Columbus, Ohio.

So you're thinking about investing in retirement plans - that's a good thing.  But maybe you're not exactly sure where you should put your money - that's not a good thing.  It's easy to get confused about funding a retirement plan, especially when it comes to tax-advantaged plans versus employer plans.
 
Retirement Planning in Your 20s
To some of you it might seem crazy to create a publication that talks about retirement planning in your 20s.  Admittedly, to most 20-somethings, retirement is so far away that it occupies very little of their thoughts.  But the reality is that a time will come when these "youngsters" will retire too.
 
Retirement Planning in Your 30s
If we had summarize what retirement planning in your 30s was all about, then it would probably go something like this...  When you're in your 30s, you are in a unique position from a retirement planning standpoint.  For most of us, these are the "make or break" years - here's why.
 
Retirement Planning in Your 40s
If you started your retirement planning early in your career, then you should be in pretty good shape by the time you're in your 40s.  If you're thinking about retirement planning for the first time, then you've got some serious catching-up to do.  That being said, retirement planning in your 40s is perhaps the single most important step you can take to prepare yourself for those retirement years.
 
If there is ever a critical time for retirement planning it's when you hit your 50s.  You've still got ten to fifteen years left in the workplace and you're entering your peak earning years.
 
Retirement Planning in Your 60s
If you agree with the mindset "it's never too late," then you'll appreciate what retirement planning in your 60s is all about.  And when it comes to retirement planning - you don't ever want to give up and concede it's too late.
 
401k Plans
Personally, we think that 401k plans are one of the premier benefits an employer can offer their workers.  They provide employees a perfect tax shelter , and most plans even include an instant return on the employee's investment.  In fact, for many investors 401k plans should be their first stop for any money earmarked for retirement.
 
401k Rules
If you're thinking about contributing to your employer's 401k plan, but need more information, we've got most of the 401k rules covered in this article.  We use the word "most" because 401k plans are tricky in that employers have some flexibility in how they can administer their plan.
 
401k Limits
Participating in a 401k plan is a great way to help you get ready for those retirement years.  In this article we are going to discuss some of the 401k limits, or rules, that all employees need to be aware of when participating in such a plan.  This includes both compensation limits, as well as contribution limits.
 
401k Retirement Plan
If you're thinking about retiring someday - and you should - then you need to think about starting a 401k plan.  If you're lucky enough to have one of these plans at work, then make sure you've signed up.  Retirement is really not that far away - ask anyone.  It sneaks up on you, so be prepared.
 
401k Rollover
When most of us talk about a retirement plan rollover, we are thinking about taking money from one retirement plan and transferring it into another plan.  In the real world, the most common rollover scenario would be if you accepted a new job and wished to rollover your 401k plan to your new company or another financial institution.
 
401k Loans
For most of us, our 401k plans are the first and only place we have reserved for consistent and "real" savings - money we put away and never intend on touching until retirement.  But what happens if we're faced with an unexpected expense?  Is getting a 401k loan possible?
 
401k Losses
On February 20, 2008, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that individuals have a right to recover 401k losses based on what were considered fiduciary breaches.  This landmark decision means that the 50 million Americans participating in a 401k plan now have a right to recover their loss if plan administrators don't fulfill what's considered their obligation to participants to manage their plans wisely.
 
In this article we're going to be discussing 401k withdrawals.  This includes early withdrawals, and allowed distributions under the current 401k rules.  We're also going to discuss the potential tax penalties for early withdrawals.
 
401k Hardship Withdrawal
You've been faithfully building your 401k plan at work, but you suddenly find yourself with a financial hardship.  This leaves you wondering - Is it possible to make a 401k hardship withdrawal?  The answer to this question is not quite that simple.
 
401k Contribution and Catch up Limits
Perhaps the single most important retirement account available to employees today is their 401k plan.  In this article we're going to discuss the current (2008 / 2009) 401k contribution limits, including catch-up limits, pre-tax and total contributions limits, as well as the limits that apply to highly-compensated employees.
 
Comparing 401k Contributions
In this article we're going to discuss the three options most of us have with respect to our 401k contributions - before-tax, after-tax, and now the Roth 401k.  Starting back in 2006, many 401k plan administrators took advantage of the new Roth 401k and started offering it to their plan's participants.  Let's take a closer look at the difference this new option can make to your 401k contribution plans.
 
401k Contribution Limits 2005
If your employer offers you a 401k plan, then consider yourself lucky.  These plans are a great way to fund your retirement .  But sometimes the 401k contribution limits can get a little confusing because there are employee matches and before-tax and after-tax limits.  Are you confused yet?
 
401k Debit Card
Borrowing from your 401k plan just got easier - all you need is a 401k debit card.  When a financial hardship comes around, it's a relief to know you can borrow from your 401k plan.  But retirement savings are just that - money you've set aside that's intended to provide income after you retire.  These two points of view are at the heart of this debit card controversy.
 
Roth IRA
The Roth IRA is perhaps the premier individual retirement planning tool and savings account offered today.  In this article we're going to discuss the full range of Roth IRA benefits, the basics of withdrawals, transfers, and contributions.  Then we'll finish up with some comparisons between the Roth IRA and employer sponsored plans such as the 401k and 403b.
 
Roth IRA Rules
Roth IRA rules are pretty straightforward because they fall into just a couple of categories that follow the typical scenarios that might happen along the way - eligibility, contributions, transfers, and withdrawals.  That's really just about all of the Roth IRA rules you'd encounter.
 
Roth IRA Limits
In this article we're going to discuss Roth IRA limits.  This includes the two broad categories of compensation/ income limits, which affect eligibility, as well as those limits that apply to contributions to a Roth IRA account.   We're also going to provide up to date information on the contribution limits for 2006, 2007 and 2008 including catch-up contributions.
 
Roth IRA Contribution Limits
In this publication we're going to discuss the Roth IRA Contribution Limits.   That discussion will include the recent changes that affect Roth IRA accounts in 2007 and 2008.  As far as the information we're going to provide, we'll address the two kinds of Roth IRA limits - one dealing with income restrictions and the other dealing with the contributions themselves.
 
Roth IRA Conversion
In this article we're going to talk about Roth IRA conversions.  This discussion will include Roth IRA contribution rules, transfers, income limits for conversions and their income tax effect.  We'll also discuss when - and under what conditions - it might be a good idea to make a conversion.
 
There are two related, but slightly different 5-year rules that apply to Roth IRA withdrawals.  The first has to do with earnings on contributions you've made to your account, while the second rule has to do with Roth IRA conversions.
 
2010 Roth IRA Conversions
Back in May of 2006 there was a pretty significant change to the tax laws involving converting a traditional IRA to a Roth IRA.  In the year 2010 everyone can convert their traditional IRAs to a Roth IRA - and that's an opportunity that not everyone had in the past.
 
Roth 401k Plans
Starting on January 1, 2006 the Roth 401k was born.  Since that time, many employees have found themselves faced with the question - Do you want to contribute to a Roth 401k?  We're going to help answer that question by discussing the Roth 401k rules, contribution limits, withdrawals / distributions, and even how to make a 401k Roth rollover.
 
Self Directed Roth IRA
If you're looking for information on a self-directed Roth IRA, consider yourself in the majority when it comes to establishing a Roth IRA account.  That's because a self-directed account is simply defined as one where the owner of the account determines where the money is invested.  That's a pretty common arrangement when it comes to Roth IRAs.
 
Traditional IRA
A Traditional IRA is a retirement plan that allows you to save money for retirement.  In the case of a traditional IRA, you may also be offered an immediate tax shelter for the contributions that you make to your account.  In this article we're going to discuss many of the different rules you'll encounter with these IRAs including eligibility, contributions, income limits and withdrawals - so let's get started.
 
SIMPLE IRA
A SIMPLE IRA is a plan that gives smaller employers an easy way to contribute towards an employee's retirement account.  The SIMPLE IRA allows the employee to make salary-reduction contributions and employers make matching contributions.  In this article we're going to discuss the benefits, eligibility rules, how to set up a SIMPLE IRA, as well as contributions and withdrawal rules.
 
Self Directed IRA
If you're one of those persons that like to take control of your money, there is good news in the form of a self-directed IRA.  Just what is a self directed IRA?  Simply put, it is an individual retirement account that is established with a stockbroker rather than a bank or an investment house.
 
IRA Rules
IRA Rules are something that we've covered before for some specific types of IRAs, but we've never put them all together in one place before.  So in this addition we are going to talk about some general IRA rules including eligibility, contributions, and withdrawals.  And where necessary, we are going to point you in the right direction for additional information.
 
IRA Rollover
In this article we are going to discuss IRA rollovers.  We'll going to start off by briefly discussing why an IRA rollover might be necessary, as well as provide you with a definition of a rollover.  We're then going to explain the difference between a rollover and a transfer, and finish up with some of the rollover rules you need to be aware of to prevent you from encountering any income tax penalties.
 
IRA Withdrawals
This article is going to cover the topic of IRA withdrawals.  Here we're going to summarize the withdrawal or distribution rules that apply to traditional IRAs, Roth IRAs and SIMPLE IRAs.  We're going to talk about normal withdrawals (or qualifying distributions), minimum required distributions, exceptions to these withdrawal rules, and possible income tax penalties.
 
IRA Contribution Limits
In this publication we're going to discuss IRA contribution limits.  That will include the recent changes for 2007 and 2008.  In this publication we will address two kinds of IRA limits, one dealing with income, and a second dealing with the contributions themselves.
 
IRA Contribution Limits 2004 and 2005
IRA Contribution Limits have been increasing over the past several years and that is good news if you're saving for retirement.  For many years, the contribution limit stood at $2,000, but policymakers have realized that inflation made this old limit inadequate in meeting the retirement needs of individuals.  So if you are using IRAs to fund retirement, we have some good news about the 2004 and 2005 limits.  We will even discuss the catch up limit that can help you get more money into your IRA faster.
 
403b
In case you're not familiar with the concept, a 403(b) account is a retirement savings plan, or tax shelter, for employees of tax exempt organizations, public school systems, and those of cooperative hospital services.  You can generalize by saying the 403b is the nonprofit organization's equivalent of the 401k.
 
403b Contribution Rules
In this article, we're going to be discussing 403b contribution rules.  Our discussion is going to include elective deferrals, after-tax contributions, and maximum allowable contributions.  We'll also run through some of the contribution rules that are unique to 403b plans such as the 15-year rule.
 
403b Distributions and Transfers
With such an unclear future for the Social Security system, individuals look to the security of supplemental retirement savings such as 403b plans.  But there comes a time when you need to take a distribution, or make a transfer, from your 403b account and the rules you need to follow can be quite complex.  We're going to help you steer clear of tax penalties by explaining the allowable 403b distributions you can take as well as the most efficient way to make a 403b transfer.
 
403b Rollover
In general, you can roll-over all or any part of a distribution from a 403b plan to a traditional IRA or an eligible retirement plan without paying any taxes.  The maximum amount eligible for a 403b rollover is the amount that would be taxable.  In other words, if you made an after-tax contribution to your 403b, then you cannot rollover that portion into tax-deferred retirement account.
 
403b Loans
Under certain conditions, it is possible to obtain a loan from your 403b plan.  But you've got to work closely with your plan administrator to make sure that the loan isn't viewed as an early distribution.  If a loan is viewed as a distribution, it'll be reported as income, and if you're under age 59 1/2, then you may be subject to a 10% tax penalty.
 
Final 403b Regulations
Only July 26, 2007, the Treasury Department in conjunction with the IRS released a finalized set of 403b regulations.  With a history dating back to the 1950's this rulemaking effort was nearly 50 years in the making, and provides 403b participants with some long-awaited guidance.
 
Roth 403b Plans
Included in the Bush Administrations Fiscal Year 2006 Budget were some changes to the way you can fund your 403b plan - the new Roth 403b.  In this publication we're going to discuss the benefits of a Roth 403b along with the rules of these plans including withdrawals / distributions, contributions, and income taxes.
 
Roth IRA versus 403b Plan
If you've been wondering whether or not to fund a Roth IRA or your 403b plan, we're going to lay out some of the things you might want to consider before making that decision.  They are both great retirement planning tools, but there may be reasons for choosing to fund one type of plan versus the other.
 
Delaying Social Security
Before you begin collecting Social Security benefits, you may want to figure out if it's to your long-term advantage to delay receiving benefits.  That's because the longer you wait until you begin collecting a monthly check from Social Security, the larger the monthly check received.
 
Coverdell Education Savings Accounts
Coverdell Education Savings Accounts seem to go by many names today - Coverdell ESA, Coverdell IRA, even Coverdale IRA (for those that are not too sure of the spelling).  Some people might even recognize this name as the replacement for the Education IRA established back in 1997.
 
Keogh Retirement Plans
Keogh plans allow self-employed individuals or small businesses the opportunity to provide employees with retirement savings benefits.  Keogh plans are sometimes referred to as qualified plans, or HR10 plans, and their rules are quite different from those that apply to Individual Retirement Accounts (IRA).
 
457 Plans
A 457 plan is a retirement / pension plan that provides benefits to government employees as well as employees of tax-exempt organizations.  Employees participating in 457 plans are allowed to defer their compensation on a before-tax basis via regular payroll deductions.  Money placed in these accounts grows on a federally tax-free basis until withdrawn.
 
457f Plans
The 457f is a deferred compensation plan that allows eligible employers to contribute money on a pre-tax basis into investments that provide key executives with a retirement benefit.  By doing so, these companies can help their executives defer payment of federal and state income tax on the money contributed into their accounts.
 
Fixed Annuities
A fixed annuity is an insurance contract in which the issuing company promises to make fixed dollar payments to the contract holder, the annuitant, for a pre-determined length of time.  In return for payment of the contract premium, the issuing company also guarantees both the earnings on the account and the principal balance.
 
Variable Annuities
A variable annuity is a contract with an insurance company in which the insurer promises to make a series of payments to the contract holder.  And unlike a fixed annuity that guarantees a series of fixed dollar payments, the value of a variable annuity will depend on the performance of the investments chosen.
 
Equity Indexed Annuity
Equity indexed annuities, or EIA, are a unique type of annuity - one that's based on a stock market index, such as the S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average, or the Russell 1000.  As a reminder, an annuity is defined as a contract with an insurance company in which the annuitant, or contract holder, agrees to make a payment or series of payments.  In exchange, the insurance company agrees to supply the contract holder with a future source of income.
 
Funding a retirement account is an important part of your financial planning process.  And when it comes to choosing between a Roth IRA and a Traditional IRA, you need to make an informed decision.
 
Minimum Required Distributions
In this article we're going to discuss minimum required distributions or MRD.  For certain retirement accounts, including 401k plans, 403b plans, and the traditional IRA minimum distributions are required.  Here we'll discuss the calculation of this distribution, and the exact MRD rules you need to follow.
 
Balancing Your Retirement Account
Investing in your retirement account isn't a one time decision - it's more like a process.  At a single point in time you made a decision to invest your money in a certain way, but as time moves forward, balancing that retirement account|
clueweb09-en0004-80-00508	16.7475414276	|Retirement Plan Rollovers: 401k, 403b, 457
(401k rollover, 403b      rollover,   457 rollover)
If you have a 401k, 403b, 457 or some other retirement plan with    a previous employer, you should strongly consider the benefits of transferring    your retirement assets into a Rollover IRA .
The  Rollover IRA is a tax advantaged IRA account designed to receive    retirement funds rolled over from an ex-employer’s retirement plan
( 401k    rollover , 403b rollover , 457 rollover ). The Rollover IRA allows funds    to be transferred tax free and penalty free from other retirement plans    and allows retirement funds already set aside to continue to grow tax    deferred until retirement.
When leaving an employer, some investors believe it is advantageous    to rollover your retirement plan into a new IRA versus leaving your    money in your old employer's retirement plan or transferring it into    your new employer's plan.
Advantages of a 401k Rollover, 403b Rollover and 457 Rollover to    an IRA
Control
When the rollover process is complete, your retirement plan assets     from your previous employer will be transferred to an IRA. Since     you are the owner of an IRA, you have complete control versus being     dependent upon the rules and policies of your former employer's     retirement plan. By rolling over your account into an IRA will not     have the potential problems seen with some 401k, 403b and 457 plans     such as untimely statements, lack of account information, or more     importantly, a limited number of investment options. Also, there     are a number of other problems that can arise with your retirement     plan should your employer have financial troubles and go into bankruptcy.     Rolling over your retirement plan to an IRA eliminates these problems     and puts you in a position to be in complete control of your retirement     account.
 
Investment Flexibility
Your previous employer’s 401k, 403b or 457 plan probably had between     10-15 mutual funds to choose from. A rollover to an IRA will increase     your investment options and will improve your investment flexibility.     Within an IRA managed by a BCM financial advisor you can invest     in stocks, bonds and over 10,000 mutual funds. At Beacon Capital     Management Advisors, we believe that over the long term greater     investment flexibility may lead to improved performance through     better diversification and increased investment selection.
 
Investment Advice
Are you receiving guidance from a financial professional with selecting     the appropriate investments in your 401k, 403b or 457? Probably     not. This is perhaps the greatest advantage of a rollover to an     IRA. If you opened an IRA rollover account, a BCM financial advisor     would help you select a diversified investment portfolio  based   on your age, time horizon and risk tolerance.

clueweb09-en0007-84-37981	16.5805034637	|What is a 401k, 403b, or 457 Rollover to an IRA?
By Scott Franklin,  eRollover 2008
Generally, after a person leaves the employment of a company, they are given the option to roll their 401K or other plans into a new company plans, or, if available, or into a Rollover IRA.
Frequently, the choice is made to roll into an IRA because of the flexibility and vast array of investment choices available. Once in an IRA, the owner is no longer restricted to the investment choices offered by their employer plan, nor is the participant subject to any potential future restrictions imposed by the new employer, if any.
Most retirement plans can be easily rolled into either a variety of mutual funds, stocks, and bonds within a Roth IRA, rollover IRA, or existing contributory IRA account, provided that you have separated service with the company where the plan is held.
However, there may be some costs to do this, as well as other ongoing expenses that should be considered as well. In addition, there may be surrender charges when you want to move some or part of your money as well. Check with your Financial Advisor and read the prospectus regarding any investments you might be considering to insure that you aren hit with any type of penalty or fee.
What are your OPTIONS when dealing with former 401k plans?
You can move/rollover, all or PART, of your 401k into a rollover IRA account.
You can move/rollover, all or PART, of your 401k into your next employer 401k or retirement plan.
You can move/rollover, all or PART, of your 401k into a Roth IRA if you are in an income bracket that willbe able to let you do so.
You can leave the funds with your past employer plan.
You can do any of the above while taking a full or partial distribution from your plan. Please keep in mind that this will trigger a taxable event of your income tax bracket, plus a 10% early withdrawal penalty on the amount that is taken.

403b Savings Calculator
403bsavingscalculator.com
What Can You Do With a 403b Savings Calculator?
Those individuals who work for a variety of non-profit agencies, colleges and universities and local governments often have an employer sponsored 403b account rather than a more common 401k. Just as with a 401k, those who have 403b accounts may find that their contributions are matched by their employers or not. Likewise, those who have a 403b account are given choices about how they want to invest, how much they want to invest and whether or not to open additional savings and investment accounts to help them prepare for retirement.
A 403b savings calculator, at its most basic, is a tool that enables those of you with 403b accounts to see how much the money that you've put into the account is earning for you. A  403b savings calculator  lets you take a closer look at your investments than you are able to do simply by looking at the statement that you receive that's meant to tell you how your account is doing.
However,  a 403b savings  calculator should do more than just let you see what is there in your account and provide you with some idea about how your  money will continue to grow over time. With the  right 403b savings calculator, you should be able to:
Look at the amount that you are contributing and determine how much of a difference a greater contribution per pay period would make in your retirement saving;
Look at the different mutual funds and stock options that you have for investing to see whether or not you would benefit by investing your 403b savings differently;
Experiment with your savings and investment strategy to see whether or not you are investing as well as you could be;
Consider the past and projected performance of the stocks and mutual funds that are available to you;
Better understand the risk that you are taking when you choose one investment over another.
Additionally, if not all of your retirement planning is being done with your 403b, you're probably going to want something more than a basic  403b savings calculator  - something like the retirement calculator you can download on this page that will allow you to do everything that you need to in order to understand your 403b savings as well as all of your other retirement savings and investment accounts.
Not only does the retirement calculator allow you to get a feel for your accounts on your own, but when you download it your contact information will be forwarded to a financial advisor in your area who will call to follow up and answer any questions that you have. In other words, you won't just get a  403b savings calculator  or a retirement calculator, you will also get the chance to talk about your goals and options with someone who can help you to develop a better strategy - a plan for reaching all of your goals, whatever they may be.
Does the  403b savings calculator you've been using do all of that?

Analysis of the Economics of Early Social Security Withdrawal
Robert J. Phillips
Chief Retirement Consultant
Deciding whether or not to take the early withdrawal of social security at age 62 can be difficult. If you need this income at 62 to fund your retirement the decision is fairly straightforward. Take it early!  On the other hand, if you have another source of revenue to fund your retirement your decision will be primarily based on lifestyle, health and investment preferences.
Several factors can affect your decision. First is your life expectancy. If you are in good health and have a family history of living beyond 90 then waiting for full benefits may be best. Two other factors impact this decision. First and most important is the value of money or your expected return from your investments. If you are using other investments instead of social security to fund your retirement you should use the rate of return of these investments as your value of money. There is another way to look at the value of money. If you do not require the social security money to live, you can invest the distributions for the future. The rate of return of this investment is your value of money. If your investments will make larger returns such as stocks this would favor taking the early withdrawal.
The last factor impacting your decision is inflation. Social security includes an annual adjustment based on inflation. You cannot control this variable but you should be aware of its impact. If future inflation is significant it will favor a later full distribution
FREE Social Security Calculator:
Find Out Your Breakeven Age
We developed a calculator to assist in analyzing the impact of taking early benefits at age 62 or waiting for full benefits at age 66 to 67 depending on the year you were born...If you were born in 1960 or later your full benefits will begin at age 67 and your reduction for early benefits at age 62 will be 30%. If you were born between 1946 and 1960 your full benefits begin as early as age 66. We have included a chart that summarizes information.
To use the calculator you need to input your year of birth. You also need to input a value of money up to 10% and a projected inflation adjustment. The calculator analyzes income generated over time from both the early and full benefit investments. It calculates the age at which full social security will catch up and breakeven with the early withdrawal. If you were born before 1960 your breakeven age will be impacted by the year you were born. An early breakeven age favors waiting for full benefits.
The social security calculator is not the final answer whether to take an early withdrawal but it does give you additional economic data to assist in that decision. Ultimately you must balance income, investments and lifestyle to optimize your enjoyment during your retirement years.

AXA Equitable is a life insurance company, not an investment fund or fund family.  The quality of the 403b plan they offer you will be largely dependent on the specific investment options they offer, and crucially on the underlying fees they charge for them.
Many life insurance companies have charged excessive fees and have offered needlessly complex products.  I would tread carefully here, and be sure to investigate what your other options are as well.

Hospitals
The contribution amounts into this type of retirement plan are made with after tax dollars. 403b plans offer the employee a chance to defer money and have it invested in dedicated mutual funds, tax deferred annuities or other securities.
Retirement Value
As with any retirement account or plan, 403b account holders will have a retirement value based on the contributions they made, the years they were in the plan, and the value of the securities within the 403b account. Diversification of funds and spreading of risk can protect the employee best and allow them to get the highest investment performance and income at retirment.

This is the  Index from 1850 Census of Lewis Co, TN.   It was  transcribed by Cheryl Zelek on 18 April 2000 from the Census of Lewis Co, TN.   These page numbers refer  to the STAMPED page numbers.   The "A" is the stamped  page and the "B" is the page that follows the stamped  page.   I eventually hope to get the entire census  transcribed and posted.   I will look up individual people.    You must give me the head of household's full name.   Limit one name per request.  These will be looked up as time permits- it may be a day or two before I get back to you.    Thanks so much for your understanding.

New 403b Plan Regulations
This section is for 403b non profit administrators and entities looking for information on the rules changes and regulation compliance issues. These final rules include developing a plan document, review operations in the 403 b plan, form 5500 requirement and reviewing frozen and current investment relationships.
Some of these new regulations will depend on the type of 403 b involved or plan status. These are generally:
Non Actively Sponsored Plans
Actively Sponsored Hybrid Account
5500
Beginning in 2009, all ERISA 403 plans must file a full form 5500 that recognizes all assets under the plan. Plans with greater than 100 participants must also meet the 5500 audit requirements and regulations. Contact us below if you have questions on this rule.
Plan Document
A plan document must be in place by the effective date of the regulations. This is an important change. If a 403 b already has a plan document, the retirement plan document must be reviewed to ensure the rules under final regulations are addressed.
Review Operations - Plan sponsors must go over their procedures so they align with what is in their new or existing 403 b plan. The regulations also call for oversight.
Non actively Sponsored Plan
Regulations provide that the account manager review the plan. These still may comply without subjecting them to ERISA. Developing a plan document and reviewing service providers for your 403b plan are included in the regulations compliance.
We are the premier training company for the financial industry. Contact us with any 403b administrator question .
Plan Owners and administrators - Ask Us With Your Questions
We are experts in the new 403 b rules and changes. You can contact us with any question or service related to any insurance or investment using our form here: Company Retirement Plan Question Form . This form is for plan administrators and owners only.
Individuals (not companies) looking for 403 plan help or any other insurance and investment question can use our Investment Help form.|

Guide to the Roth 401k/403b
Learn how a Roth 401k or 403b account works, and why this may be the     best choice for your retirement savings at work.
Beginning in 2006, 401k and 403b participants at many companies can choose to make  their retirement plan contributions to an account that works much like a  Roth IRA. We have complete coverage of these accounts, including an  explanation of how they make it possible to build more wealth for your  retirement. Throughout these pages, references to 401k apply to 403b  accounts as well.
The Pension Protection Act of 2006 removes the sunset provision for the Roth 401k, making this savings option      permanent.

clueweb09-en0008-41-10509	15.5919761658	|Monday, Jan 12 in Debt || Comments (0)
Question: Susan's mom tried to commit suicide this weekend. She had been hiding $40,000 in debt from Susan's dad. They make $4,000 a month, but half that goes to one loan they borrowed against retirement. He has $100,000 in a 403b plan and they have car debt. Dave knows a couple ways out of this, but he reminds Susan of the top priority.
Dave Ramsey's advice: I wouldn't borrow more against my 403b. I'm thinking of just canceling that loan out because it's destroying them. They could easily live on $3,000 a month and put the other money against the credit card debt, and clean that up. More than anything, your mom needs some in-depth counseling. There's nothing financially that can be fixed by that; she's facing shame for the way they've handled money.
They have to sit down and develop a game plan. They may get out of this with a little bit of money, and their cars and their house. I don't like the fact that they have no money, but that's almost where they are. I don't like the suggestion, but you might consider paying off the credit cards and the 403b loan with the 403b money.
They have to agree to live on a plan that they put together. It wasn't the debt that got her to think this way, it was the shame that she let her husband down. Take care of mom and help her have a better understanding of her value and have her maintain a lifestyle that they can afford. They are either going to fight their way through this debt or not have the 403b left.|

Question:
I am 40. I am contemplating selling an inherited property for a net of        around $1MIL. As I am disabled, I work freelance from home so income I        generate is not constant and very low. With the markets as they are and        everything losing.......what is the best way to invest this money so that        I do not risk the principal and have a livable 'wage' every year????
Response:
There is always a trade off between the return you receive on your        investment and the amount of risk that the principal is in. The least        risky investment that you could invest your money in would be CD's or a        money market account. These types of investments pay 3-4% interest and, on        a million dollars, would yield about $30,000 to $40,000 per year. However,        since you are still young and have such a long time to live, if you spend        the $30-$40k yield each year, your principal will not grow and the value        of $30-40k will decline quite significantly over time. A balanced        portfolio, that provides enough growth to fund your future requirements,        but that reduces as much risk as possible, would seem more appropriate.        Typically, a portfolio like this would consist of 60-70% stocks (mutual        funds), 15-25% bonds (bond funds) and 10-15% cash (money markets or CDs).        In your case, you'd probably want to adjust the level of stocks down and        bonds and cash upward.
Unfortunately, there are too many alternatives to go over in an email.        If you really need help investing your money, you may want to meet with a        financial advisor. You can find one at your local bank or at financial        service companies like American Express. Be careful who you pick as the        full service providers charge big fees and the banks don't often have a        good portfolio of investments to offer. If you are interested in investing        the money yourself, you can easily do it through a low cost online        investment account at etrade. They offer access to almost all publicly        traded mutual funds and bond funds, as well as competitive money market        accounts.
Question:
I have a question I have been trying to get an answer to with no        success. Does it make sense to pay down my mortgage by making extra        payments if I plan to sell the house in 5 years or less? I hope you can        help. Thanks.
Response:
It definitely doesn't hurt to make extra payments on your mortgage. The        key in looking at a decision like this is to make sure that you are        optimizing your money. Make sure that you are paying off your highest        interest rate debt. If your mortgage rate is 7% and your tax rate is 40%,        then your net mortgage rate is really only 4.2%. If you have any credit        card debt or other debt that is higher than this rate (auto loan, boat        loan, student loan, etc) it might make sense to pay that debt off first.
Alternatively, if you thought you could invest the money and receive a        return greater than your mortgage rate, that would also be a reasonable        alternative to paying down your mortgage.
Getting back to your original question, it definitely makes sense to        pay down your mortgage faster. Every extra payment that you make will not        only reduce the amount of interest and increase the principal payment of        the loan, but it will also do so for every payment made in the future (in        your case, for the next five years).
Question:
We are a retired couple Given the problems with the stock market, does        a savings account paying 3% sound like a good place for us to park our        money? We're afraid that it's being eaten up by the bad stock market and        we are probably too old to play the "stay in for the long
run" game. We have less than $100,000 in retirement savings.
Response:
If you don't have a long term investment horizon and you are worried        about volatility, then leaving your money in a savings account or a CD may        be your answer, and the stock market isn't for you. However, if you have        at least 10 years left to invest and have other sources of income to rely        on, I wouldn't suggest parking all of the money in a savings account.        Throughout history, the stock market has yielded positive returns over        every 10 year period and has returned 2-3 times the average savings        account rate. Also, it appears that the economy is turning upward and that        the market has already declined for the past 3 years, meaning that if history is any guide, the market is due for a rebound over the next        several years. With that said, I'm not suggesting that you invest solely        in the stock market, but you may want to diversify your portfolio to        include a small percentage of lower risk mutual funds or bond funds. Here        are a few guidelines about choosing investments:
NEVER invest any money that you don't feel comfortable losing at least        some of
Never invest in something you aren't comfortable with or don't believe        in
Try not to get caught up in the terribly negative or positive sentiment        of the stock market, but understand that the sentiment's exist and that        they influence stock prices and hence, interest rates
Stick to your investment strategy and don't change it unless your life        dictates a change. In your case, since you are in retirement, it makes        sense to remain conservative in your investments
Instead of buying individual stocks or bonds, purchase funds that        contain a large number of different stocks and bonds.
Question:
I have many questions about my family's financial situation and was        hoping to receive some practical advise. We are in loads of debt. We have        a mortgage of 143,000 that we refinanced at 4.75% (adjustable). We        consolidated our credit card debt with a home equity loan of 40,000 at        10%. My husband has grad school loans of 30,000 that we will need to repay        in October. We have no savings other than his 401k plan with 7000. We        stopped contributing to it because we were not able to buy food. My        husband earns 54,000 a year and I am a stay at home mom with one young        child. What should we do? I think we should sell the house because it's        getting down to not having food. My husband thinks we should keep the        house and wait till he finds a higher paying job. Please offer some good        ideas!
Response:
You are indeed in a tough situation. I can't think of any immediate        solution and I definitely can't tell you whether to sell your house or        not, but here are some ideas that you may want to consider:
If you sell your house will it be a lot cheaper to rent an apartment?        In other words, will you save a lot of money if you sell your house? Since        you already have a first and second mortgage, it sounds like most of the        equity has already been taken out of your house. If that is the case, and        you sell it, you will have to pay a 6% fee to a real estate broker to sell        it and you will have to pay capital gain taxes on any increase in value.        Furthermore, the interest associated with your first and second mortgage        are now tax deductible but you will lose that status if you sell your        house.
If you sell your house to buy a less expensive house, make sure that        you take into account all of the expenses associated with switching        houses. Expenses include: a 6% broker fee to sell your house; closing        costs, credit reports, appraisals, building inspections, moving costs,        etc.
Also, if it is important to get ahead in the long-term, it is important        to build the value of your assets and right now your house is probably        your only real asset (by real I mean tangible, other assets you have are        your husband's long term earnings power). Also, a
house is a great way to reduce your overall interest rates (through        second mortgages and HELOCs) that are usually tax deductible. A house also        offers a lot of tax deductions that will save you money at the end of each        year.
You may be able to defer the payments on the student loan by filing        hardship or using one of the other flexible payment options that often        accompany student loans.
The best ideas I can think of are for you to find ways to save money.        Can you get a lower phone rate, get rid of a car, lower your insurance,        buy cheaper diapers, etc. There are thousands of creative ways to save        money. I've listed some of the ones I can think of on my site at http://www.free-financial-advice.net/save-money.html.        (If you think of any other good ideas, email me and I will add them to        this page.) Look at every penny you spend and try to reduce or eliminate        it.
If you can hold on and increase your income over time (husband gets        that new job), things will get easier and you will make progress on your        debt. If you are too uncomfortable living with the stress of debt, then        selling the house may be the right thing to do.
Also, if you are overcome by debt, you could go through a form of        bankruptcy that would protect your 401K and house but that could reduce        your debt payments (especially your second mortgage). This would have a        severe effect on your credit and should only be looked at in severe times.
Question:
I am 35 yrs old. I have a house I rent out that I owe about $80,000. I        only have 1 credit card for about $1,200.00. Should I pay off my house or        put my money into a 403B plan? Also what's the best way to pay off your        mortgage? I heard if you pay an extra payment per year on the principal it        will take you down 7 years is that correct?
Response:
The decision is yours to make, but here are my thoughts:
Regarding the 403b vs paying off your mortgage:
The 403b investment is tax deferred.
The 403b investment will diversify your portfolio.
You will likely, over the long-run, earn more money by investing in a        403b than by paying off your mortgage quickly.
When you need the money at retirement, it is easier to withdraw it from        a 403b plan than to withdraw it from your house. However, if you need to        raise money before retirement, you can usually easily access the equity in        your home through a home equity loan.
By paying the loan off early, you will actually disadvantage yourself        from a tax advantage standpoint (because the interest on a mortgage is tax        deductible).
Regarding your question about paying off your mortgage quicker by        making an extra payment each year: Yes, it's true that making an extra        payment each year will vastly reduce the amount of time it takes to pay        off your loan. The reason you pay it off much faster is because, at the        beginning of a 30 year loan, your initial payments are 95% interest. By        making the extra payment, the entire payment (instead of only 5%) gets        applied to and reduces your loan balance. It's never a bad idea to make        extra payments on your mortgage or to make larger payments each month on        your mortgage.
Question:
I am considering selling my condo and investing the money about        $200,000 and putting it in a market fund or something and living off the        interest for awhile, say 3 years while I attend graduate school. How much        could I earn a year? What are the tax ramifications? And am I insane?
Response:
Selling your condo may or may not be a good idea, here are some things        to consider:
You will have to pay taxes on any gains from the sale (if you bought it        for $100k and sold it for $200k, then $100k would be taxed at a rather        high tax rate).
You will have to pay a real estate broker 6% of the net sale if you        sell it
If you invest the proceeds in a market fund as you suggest, it is        impossible to tell how that fund would perform over the next three years.        Your earnings would depend on how you invested it. A money market account        would earn about $5,000 per year with little risk while purchasing a stock        mutual fund could yield anywhere from a 50% loss to a 50% gain.
Another alternative is to keep your condo and take out a home equity        line of credit that would give you enough leeway to support you while you        go to graduate school. That way, you wouldn't have to pay taxes on the        sale, you'd keep the condo as an investment and you would get a tax        benefit from the interest that you pay on the HELOC. Also, if you didn't        want to live in the condo, you could rent it out and get rental income.
If you feel the need to diversify your investments, you could take 50%        of the equity in your condo (thru a home equity loan) and invest it in        stocks, bonds or money markets.
Investing, even in panicked days like this, is not crazy at all (you        asked if you were insane). What is really crazy are the people that        continue to unload their investments at all time lows. The only problem I        see with you investing your money is that you need the money during the        next 3 years, which means you don't have a long time to wait for the        market to perform. In cases like this, you probably shouldn't take on a        lot of risk.
I have links to some home equity loan providers at: http://www.free-financial-advice.net/loans.html
Follow Up Question:
If you will grant me two more questions...
First question. I was under the impression that you were allowed to        sell a primary residence and not pay capital gains taxes one time in your        life. Is that not so?
Also, if I pocketed $200,000. How much annual interest would that        generate? Would it be enough to live on? I guess not in the money market        as you indicated that would reap about $5000 a year?
Thanks so much...Why is this free?
Follow Up Response:
To answer your questions:
1 - I'm a little rusty on all of the tax laws. I know you can get out        of capital gains by rolling the gains over into a new house but I don't        think you would be exempt from paying the taxes if you sold outright. You        should check with a tax advisor, an accountant or even your real estate        broker to get better info than mine.
2 - You answered your own question about how much $200k would yield in        a money market account. However, say you need $25k per year to go to        school. The interest would earn about $5k per year and you would need to        dip into about $20k of the principal. At the end of graduate school, you        should have about $140k left. ($200k + $5.5k - $25k + $5k - $25k + $4.5k -        $25k).
3 - My site is free because I like to help people and because it's        mostly a hobby to me. Since I get paid small fees when visitors apply for        credit cards, loans or visit other sites that my site links to, I am able        to pay for the most of the hosting fees and the fees to get listed in        yahoo and other directories so that people like you can find me.
Question:
I have a 403b account invested in an annuity. I do not contribute to it        since my employer changed to another retirement provider. It is my        understanding that if I rollover this account, it needs to be done in a        way it remains a 403b. I would like to rollover this fund into a pure        stock purchase and hold that stock until I retire. Can that be done and        still remain under the umbrella of a 403b plan?
Response:
Good news! You should be able to roll your 403b into a Rollover IRA        account. A Rollover IRA account will allow you to invest in anything you        want, including money market accounts, stocks, bonds, mutual funds and        bond funds. Also, by keeping it in a rollover account, you will be able to        transfer the money back to a 403b plan if you ever desire. To learn more        about a rollover account, check with your favorite broker. I use E*trade        for my 401k rollover.

The ticket pickup location will be in the Expo registration area. If you decline to sign the Release And Waiver, you will not beallowed to pitch.  You may sell your tickets to another registrant(who must sign the release), but otherwise, your tickets will beforfeited if you decline to sign.    
Step 5 — Go to Your                             Pitch Meetings.
The tickets that you purchase will have the name of the production                            company you will be meeting with as well as the time of your session.                            You must be in line for your session at least 15 minutes before your                            scheduled time.  The pitch meetings will be held in Room 403B at the Los Angeles Convention Center.   If you miss your session, no refunds                            will be given for your unused pitch ticket.
Step 4 — Pitch Your                             Script.
Each pitch will last up to 5 minutes. At the 5-minute mark a bell will                            ring and you will have 10 seconds to leave the table. You need to move                            quickly so the writer with the next appointment can sit down and begin                            his or her pitch. If you finish your meeting with a production company                            before the 5 minutes are up, please leave the table as soon as                            possible.
Step 5 — Follow Up:  Understand What A "Polite Pass" Is
Afteryou pitch your story or screenplay, the executive may or may notrequest to see a copy of your script. If the company does requestyour script, proper protocol is tomail a copy a few days after the event with a polite cover letterreminding the agent, producer or company of your meeting and therequest. If your script was not requested, it is bad form to send it. DO NOT follow up with a phone call unless asked to.
The "Polite Pass":  A "polite pass" is a diplomatic way of saying "No, thank you"without stating an outright rejection.  The "polite pass" hasemerged as a common response because none of us likesrejection, some people respond quite badly to rejection, and noone likes having to reject your work.   If a company does not ask for your script in the pitch, youshould consider that as a"polite pass."  If the company does askfor your script, and you send it, and you do not hear back, that isalso a "polite pass."  
Failure to accept a"polite pass" for what it is marks you as an amateur or a potentiallydifficult person.  Please accept each "polite pass" for what itis. 
Disclaimer
The Screenwriting Expo secures agreements to appear from each producer                            prior to announcing the executive's commitment to the Pitch Meetings.                            Unfortunately, for any number of reasons, one or more executives may be                            unable to appear or may not arrive at their scheduled time. The                            Screenwriting Expo will have back-up executives available to hear                            pitches in the event that any executives are unable to meet their                            contractual obligation. In the event that an executive does not appear, a                            make-up pitch will be arranged with one of our back-up executives.

The problem with the ING Opportunity Plus 403(b) plan
I recently did a story on the mutually beneficial relationships between unions and the retirement plans they endorse.  The point of the article was that consumers should be aware that while unions generally exist to help their members, they also need money to survive.  The donations they receive may encourage them to endorse an investment or insurance product which isnt the vehicle best suited for performance, or the best deal in terms of cost and expenses.  If somebody is pushing for their product to be sold, its most likely not the best product because really good deals seem to publicize themselves.
I believe the ING Opportunity Plus 403b plan is truly not in the best interests of most of the hundreds of thousands of people invested in it.  The only reason this plan can fly with school districts in the first place is that 403b plans are funded primarily by employees in the plan.  The school doesnt match your contribution the way a 401k plan might.  This lets the school off the hook in terms of all responsibilities besides the fiduciary duties involved with administering the plan.  Further, it allows ING to make out like bandits by playing the roll of advocate rather than salesman.  They should just come right out and explain that they are as profit-motivated as the next guy.  They certainly demonstrate this by locking teachers up into variable annuity sub-accounts which are expensive and have complicated withdrawal fees.
I should point out that I like to give people the benefit of the doubt- I even tried to do this with ING by researching the Opportunity Plus program on INGs website to see if maybe I was missing something.  I wasnt and I will continue to speak to teachers in the New York area about this since ING does not provide what I consider to be adequate disclosure about many aspects of their product.  This morning I had my worst experience with ING to date.  I called up the Opportunity Plus service center- the place where you direct questions about your investments and can make changes such as switching from one fund to another.  I called because a client of mine wants to switch her assets out of the plan and into another product.  I wanted to make sure she wouldnt get hit with any withdrawal penalties for making this change.  Naturally, they arent going to give me information about a clients account that isnt on the telephone with me.  However, consumers have the right to ask generic questions about a product and get a generic answer.  The representative on the telephone wouldnt answer my generic questions about  deferred sales charges  on the Opportunity Plus product.  I wasnt unfriendly or unreasonable, but I think she started to feel uncomfortable.  She hung up the telephone abruptly when I started to push a bit more about these hidden fees.  Never in my five years advising on 403b investments have I been hung up on by a customer service line.  Not a good idea for ING considering they are involved with an investigation by Attorney General Eliot Spitzer for their too-friendly relationship with the teachers union.
I will continue giving seminars on proper ways to handle 403b investments in the future.  Its my hope to shed some light on complicated issues which are slowly draining retirement assets from people who cant afford to be doing so.  This is no secret to Congress and they are actively trying to reform situations like this from continuing in the future.  If you or somebody you know works for an organization that has a 403b program, please encourage them to do research on what they are investing in and speak to a trusted advisor about how to maximize these benefits.

Vesting - 401k vested 100%, rules
Since 401k's are an employer-employee trust or matching plan, money is deposited into the account for the benefit of the employee.
When money is contributed to a 401k plan by the employee of a company - that contribution is 100% the employees money should he or she leave a company. However the employer portion of the contribution is not 100% vested to the employee at the time of contribution if the person has not completed their vesting period. The rules and regulations must be disclosed at the time of plan participation.
To be 100% vested, a company employee involved in the corporate retirement plan must be at their job a certain persiod of time before 100% of the contributions made by the company in the 401k for the benefit of the individual is all theirs to withdraw, transfer or rollover. This period is usually 5 years or so.
A 401 k plan is a company retirement account that was set up as a loyalty program as well as an investment account. To be 100% vested is an important time period to look at especially is the company is matching at a high dollar amount.
Some people at companies will have different schedules to when they are fully vested.|

The University's Voluntary 403(b) Plan
The University's supplemental retirement plan, frequently referred to as a Tax-Deferred Annuity (TDA) plan or a Tax Sheltered Annuity (TSA) plan, is a defined contribution retirement plan that operates under Section 403(b) of the Internal Revenue Code. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) on July 26, 2007 issued new 403(b) regulations . The new regulations amend the original regulations that were issued in 1964 and will generally be effective on January 1, 2009.
The University's 403(b) Plan provides a unique savings opportunity to University of Massachusetts employees. Your contributions to the plan are made through payroll reduction, making regular savings easy for you. There is no contribution from the University. The payroll system reduces your pay by the amount of your contribution before it applies Federal and Massachusetts state income taxes to your check.
Your contribution is sent directly to the plan carrier (also referred to as "plan provider"), which you select from among the University's approved providers, where it will be invested according to your instructions. Your plan carrier will maintain an account that you own. You will direct how the carrier manages your investments.
The three approved providers for the University's 403(b) Plan are as follows:

clueweb09-en0009-79-14364	15.0500469208	|Q  How will changing W-4 affect my payroll deposit? 
 
A The Missouri Department of Revenue has a tax calculator that will help you decide how to change both the federal W-4 and/or the MO W-4.  To use, look up your last monthly earnings statement in My Information.  Be sure to use taxable federal gross to enter into the calculator.  http://www.dort.mo.gov/tax/calculators/withhold/withholdingRegPay.asp
 
Q  I currently have my net pay deposited into two accounts, $300 going to one account and the remainder in another. I am planning on setting up a 457b retirement plan through Citistreet. Once I start that, I would like to drop the $300 from the other account. When do I need to have my changes/paperwork in by?
A  457b plans are started and modified through Citistreet’s web site.  Payroll is notified of changes each month on the 5th and 20th.  Generally changes on the report received on the 20th are included on the current month’s payroll.  December is the only month that they are always too late to be included.  If you have started your 457b plan before the 5th, you can use My Information – Payroll Direct Deposit to delete your $300 deposit account or you can complete the Direct Deposit Form-Payroll and bring it to Payroll.  If you start the process later in the month please call Payroll on the 20thto check whether or not the deferral will be made.
Q  Could I have my paycheck deposited into three separate accounts—savings, a checking account and a 457b retirement account? Or can I only pick two?
A  You may have two (2) accounts to deposit the total of your net pay.  Retirement accounts, both 403b and 457 accounts are reductions to salary and are not a part of your net pay.  The result is you can have money sent to two different retirement plans and two different bank accounts, too. 
Q  I am a Per Course Instructor the fall semester.  When will I receive my pay?
A  Provided all paperwork has reached HR and Payroll you will receive ¼ of your semester pay the last banking day of the month beginning September and ending December.  If this is the first time you have taught, or are returning after not teaching for a semester, you will need to complete a new I-9 and a W-4.  Be sure to check your direct deposit information to make sure your pay will be deposited in the correct account.  If you teach in the spring, your pay will begin February and end May.
Q  I am a Per Course Instructor.  Why is my December (or May) pay a paper check and not a direct deposit?
A  As a semester employee, your job record has a December (May) end date.  The Handbook requires a check for the last payment of an appointment so that the University is assured that all property and required information is turned in before releasing the final check.  If you have been reappointed for the next semester AND the information has been communicated to HR, every effort will be made to convert your pay into a direct deposit.
Q  I fill out a time record.  When I get paid the end of June, am I getting paid for May?
A  Each month end, you receive pay for that month.  We use an anticipatory payroll which means it is assumed that each employee will either work the entire month, or have enough paid leave to cover any absences.  Your time record is due on the first work day of the month after you have been paid for that month.  The information on the time record is used to calculate any overtime due you or any hours that must be docked from your pay.
Q  I have received approval from my supervisor for more time off than I have in my vacation balance.  Is there anything that needs to be done about the 4 days without pay other than record it on my time record?
A  Always complete a leave form for leave without pay of more than 8 hours during the month it is to occur.  That way the hours can be docked from the correct month.
Q  How do I record on my time record a day that I worked 4 hours and took 4 hours of vacation.
A  Follow the directions found on the back of the time record.  Leave the calendar section blank and use two exceptions boxes to record each part, one for 4 hours W and one for 4 hours V.
Q  How can I determine what to claim on my W-4?
A  One helpful tool is found on the IRS web site. It is called the withholding calculator. http://www.irs.gov/individuals/article/0,,id=96196,00.html To see what a change in exemptions will do to your tax withholdings, the Missouri Department of Revenue has a tool to use.  http://dort.mo.gov/tax/calculators/withhold/
Q  How do I stop my 403b salary reduction?
A  The cancellation form needs to be in the payroll office by the last working day of the month to stop the next month’s contribution.  If you have terminated the policy, send the cancellation form to the Payroll Office the same month the policy is terminated to prevent an extra month from being taken from your pay.  You may cancel your contribution by sending an email to Payroll@missouristate.edu with the same information found in the form.  Include only the last four digits of your social security number.
Q  What forms do I need if I’m changing my 403b company?
A  First, contact a representative of the new company you have chosen to start a contract.  Complete a 403b salary reduction agreement.  A cancellation form (link) for the former company must accompany a new 403b salary reduction agreement (link). Turn both forms in to the Payroll Office by the last banking day of the month for the reduction to begin the following month, for example:  forms must be to Payroll by April 30th to be used on the May 31st payroll.
Q  How do I find out what I made this month and the total for the year?
A  Monthly and Year-to-Date payroll information is available through My Information.
Q  I would like to know my vacation and sick leave balance.  Why is it always at least a month behind?
A  Benefit usage and balances for vacation, sick leave and compensatory time are located in My Information.  Balances can’t be updated until the time records are loaded into the leave system.  It takes until about the 25th of the month to process all of the time records and close leave for the previous month.
Q  I am a 1000 hour employee and turn in a time card each month.  How can I know when I’m getting close to the limit?
A  Hours reported for the past 12 months for part-time employees paid with a timecard and Student employees are found through My Information.  Supervisors might appreciate a copy your total.
Q  Why can’t I use the information on the year-to-date screen after December to file my taxes?
A  W-2 earnings include non-monetary taxable fringe benefits and manual corrections made after the December payrolls were finalized.  Taxable benefits include gift certificates and other non-monetary benefits.  They are not reflected on the year-to-date screen, only on the actual monthly earnings statement and the W-2.|

The Smartest 401k Book You'll Ever Read: Maximize Your Retirement Savings...the Smart Way!
The Tax Advantages of an Individual Savings Account (ISA)
The successor to the TESSA, the ISA (or individual savings account) provides a government regulated savings scheme for encouraging individuals to save rather than spend as a means of economic and financial control. By encouraging saving in the economy, inflation can be kept at a sustainable and manageable level, particularly where the economy is otherwise performing well, and the ISA has proven to be an invaluable asset for maintaining economic stability in this way. But what exactly are the tax benefits of the individual savings account, and how do they work in practice for those looking to stash some extra money into savings?
Monetarist economics revolves around the basic idea of controlling the amount of disposable income available and the money supply in an attempt to curb or stimulate economic growth as the particular economic climate demands. One means of doing this is to try to encourage the general population to hold onto their money for longer, rather than the excessive spending that can push up inflation and put pressure on the economy. The ISA works by encouraging those with excess cash to put it aside without having to worry about the associated tax burden. Payments into an ISA are tax deductible from income, and the interest accrued within the ISA is also tax free. In fact, the capital gains from an ISA are also tax free upon withdrawal, which ultimately makes it a valuable way to make money from your money.
Under normal savings schemes and taxation principles, paying money into an account cannot be deducted from your taxable income, meaning you still have to pay tax on the full amount include the sums paid into your savings as if it were income earned. However, by turning this on its head and allowing a deduction, savings can actually help reduce the direct tax burden, and so by encouraging saving in this type of account by reducing the amount of tax the saver has to pay. Secondly, the fact that the money in the savings account is allowed to earn money through investment tax free make it a prudent way to store your money and allow it to work for you, rather than the tax which is deducted at source from income earned in a regular savings account. Finally upon withdrawal from the account, there is no tax to be borne, leading to an all round attractive investment proposal for those with the disposable income to afford it.
Savings can be a great way to earn money from excess cash, and provide you with the resources to see you through for that rainy day. Within your annual personal savings limit, the ISA can be the best possible way to make a decent return on your money through high-yield low risk investments. Whereas normally one is liable for tax on the totality of his income above the annual allowance, the individual savings account allows you to make the most of your money whilst also saving from the tax implications of having excess income.
Self-Directed IRA/401K Fees -- What Gives?!
It is fair to say that any of us, regardless of what we do for a living, need and should be compensated for our livelihood. This goes for any facilitator, administrator or custodian of self-directed IRA and 401K accounts. In many cases, not only is a client paying for the services rendered, but also the expertise of the individual or firm providing the service.
However, with the plethora of individuals/firms providing services in the arena of self-directed IRA and 401K accounts, there are some unique differences in the amount of fees charged for these services. Please note that this article is not intended to call into question what fee structures are being utilized, but to educate individuals on some salient points related to these fee structures.
First, as a reminder, there are practical differences in services rendered by facilitators, administrators and custodians which may significantly justify a particular fee structure. One must determine if the level of services warrants certain fees. For a refresher on the differences between facilitators, administrators and custodians, please review a previous Fulcrum Investment Network blog.
For the buying public, I recently investigated the fees of two administrator companies to determine the costs associated with establishing a self-directed IRA or 401K. In fairness, the information provided herein was confirmed with both companies. Note: an interesting point. Both of the companies, while not personally establishing a SD 401K, will "farm it out" to a third party and prefer not to do 401K plans accordingly.
To draw a conclusion, one must understand the hypothetical parameters utilized in comparing costs and fees, etc. For this article, the following hypotheticals were used:
$500,000 -- amount to be transferred from a "traditional" custodian to the new company (administrator). Investments Owned by the IRA/401K -- 4 (two real estate holdings and 2 mutual funds). Assets Held -- All 4 assets were held for the year and then sold at the end of the plan year. $50,000 -- amount in liquid, money market account within the IRA/401K.
Company A
Account Set Up Fee (Initial Fee) $ 50.00
Investment Transaction Fees $ 800.00 ($100.00 per asset transaction, both purchase and sale)
Annual Account Maintenance Fee $ 1,000.00
Minimum Total First Year Fees $ 1,850.00
Company B
Account Set Up Fee (Initial Fee) $ 50.00
Investment Transaction Fees< $ 800.00 ($100.00 per asset transaction, both purchase and sale).
Annual Account Maintenance Fee $1,850.00
Minimum Total First Year Fees $2,700.00
Wait (Wait #1), that's not it!
This example is for an IRA. The costs for a self-directed 401K increase by a minimum of $300.00 for an annual review of the 401K plan document to ensure compliance.
Wait (Wait #2), want more?? The aforementioned fees do not include any of the following (that a client may or may not utilize):
Domestic or International Wire Transfers; Cashier's or other Official Bank Check; Overnight mail; Returned items of any kind; Reprocessing of incomplete documents; Loan or Mortgage Servicing Set-up and Deman for Payoff; Re-registration of assets; In kind distributions; Partial or Full Termination fees; and, Late fees.
WAIT (Wait #3). Remember in the aforementioned example, $50,000 was left in a liquid, money market account? In the case of these two companies, any funds that are retained in the account and NOT invested into a traditional or non-traditional asset, receive interest. Well, we do know that interest rates vary; however, a client with either of these companies receive 1/2 of 1% interest on that money while not invested. Is this a revenue source for the administrator/custodian? Absolutely. Because while we do know that banks are not paying much in interest on such accounts, my last observation was that they were paying more than 1/2 of 1%. Therefore, the additional interest is retained by the administrator/custodian.
Please keep in mind that the aforementioned example with the two companies is an illustrative example of what is "out there" in the market place. It is not to suggest that these two companies' fees are either the highest or the lowest. It is also not to suggest that their fees are not justified. A consumer must do their due diligence to determine not only their comfort level with any facilitator, administrator or custodian but also know exactly what they are being charged in fees so that they can do diligent shopping of services.
If one are interested in self-directing, do it! Just be thorough in your due diligence. The amount of fees you pay does make a difference not only to you and your pocket book but also to your ROI (return on investment). No one wants to see their ROI gobbled up with fees.

Power of Pre-Tax
Pre-tax is the ability to take money from your check before it's taxed. The 403b is pre-tax, so the money placed into your 403b actually reduces your taxable income and therefore reduces your tax liability. After-tax money is the money that makes up your take home pay.
Let's say that you want to save $100 per month and are in the 25% tax bracket.
If you use after-tax money to save $100, you actually need to make $133 gross just to save $100.  Why?  Because you have to pay taxes before you can save anything.  If you are in the 25% tax bracket when you make $133 you pay $33 in taxes and are left with $100.
Now if you take that same $133 and put it towards your pre-tax 403b, you will save the entire $133. This has the same affect as the after-tax on your take home pay, so although you would still only feel a $100 decrease, you will have put $133 into your savings.
Why lose $33 to taxes? It's your money, keep it.

I posted this message this morning on the Vanguard forum and now realize that perhaps this site is more appropriate since 50% of our portfolio is invested in my TIAA-CREF guaranteed annunity.
My husband and I recently spoke with a fee only Financial Advisor and asked him to analyze our portfolio.  In addition to the 50% in TIAA we have 18% in Exxon Mobil stock and the remainder in a Vanguard IRA and some CDs.  We have been retired for 8 years and are able to meet expenses with our pensions and ss.  However, we now have concerns about inflation and outliving our money.  The FA suggested an asset allocation of 30% equity and 70% income with all of our funds invested in ETF "index funds."  This would involve the sale of stock, roll overs of the TIAA and IRA along with the CDs.  He could manage our portfolio for 1% fee for assets up to 500K and .75 for over 500K.  We are struggling with turning over the management of our portfolio since we have always self-managed.  All of our funds would be deposited into two brokerage accounts.
Any input would be appreciated.

Tax-Deferred Retirement Plans
Tax-Deferred Retirement Plans
401k, 403b & 457 Plan  
Here at District 11 we are proud to offer a      variety of tax-deferred retirement plans through payroll      deduction to fit your individual needs.  It is our belief      that these plans provide an important supplement to your primary      retirement vehicle, PERA.  The District offers 3      tax-deferred retirement plans: 401k, 403b and 457.  While      each plan offers the primary advantage of long-term tax-deferred      investing for retirement, each plan also has unique      characteristics to suit you individual needs.  The      following is a brief description of each plan:
401k - Offered by PERA
PERA 401k PLAN
The 401(k) plan is a type of
employer-sponsored retirement plan in the United States and some other countries , named after a section of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code . A 401(k) plan allows a worker      to save for retirement while deferring income taxes on the saved money and earnings until      withdrawal. The employee elects to have a portion of his or her wage paid directly, or "deferred", into his or her      401(k) account. In participant-directed plans (the most common option), the      employee can select from a number of investment options, usually      an assortment of mutual funds that emphasize stocks , bonds , money market investments, or some mix of the above.      Many companies' 401(k) plans also offer the option to purchase      the company's stock. The employee can generally re-allocate      money among these investment choices at any time. In the less      common trustee-directed 401(k)      plans, the employer appoints trustees who decide how the plan's      assets will be invested.  All assets in 401(k) plans are tax deferred . Before the January 1, 2006 effective      date of the designated Roth account provisions, all 401(k)      contributions were on a pre-tax basis (i.e., no income tax is withheld on the income in the year it is      contributed), and the contributions and growth on them are not      taxed until the money is withdrawn.  
403b - Offered by a variety of Vendors
A 403(b) plan is a tax advantaged
retirement savings plan available for public education organizations , some non-profit employers (only US Tax Code 501(c)(3) organizations) and self-employed ministers in the United States . It has tax treatment extremely similar      to a 401(k) plan, especially after the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 .      Simply put, employee salary deferrals into a 403(b) plan are      made before income tax is paid on it, and allowed to grow tax      deferred until the money is taxed as income when taken out of      the plan. Beginning in 2006, 403(b) and 401(k) plans may also      include designated Roth contributions, i.e., after-tax contributions,      which, if certain requirements are met, will allow tax-free      withdrawals. Primarily the designated Roth contributions have to      be in the plan for at least five taxable years.
The Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) does      not require 403(b) plans to be technically "qualified" plans,      i.e., plans governed by US Tax Code 401(a), but have the same      general appearance as
qualified plans. The option is available      but it is not known how prevalent or if any 403(b) has been      started or amended to be ERISA qualified because the main      advantage of ERISA plans for participants has been in bankruptcy of the account holder which has been      removed by the October 2005 Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act .      However, they are very different in some fundamental ways. To      the participant, the plan appears almost exactly the same and      the options available are very similar. The only important      differences for the participant are some additional ways that      they can withdraw employer money, not salary-deferral money,      before the typical 59 1/2 age restriction, but only if the plan      is funded with annuities , not mutual funds . The government is proposing that this      difference be eliminated in proposed regulations that are      expected to be finalized in 2007.
457 Plan - Sponsored by the State of Colorado and administered      by Great-West Life
State of Colorado 457 Plan
The 457 plan is a type of tax advantaged defined      contribution retirement plan that is      available for governmental and certain      non-governmental employers in the United States . The employer      provides the plan and the employee defers compensation into it on      a pre- tax basis. For the most part the plan operates similarly to a 401(k) or 403(b) plan most people are      familiar with in the US. The key difference is unlike a 401(k)      plan, there is no 10% penalty for withdrawal before the age of      59 1/2 (although the withdrawal is subject to ordinary income taxation).|

"Who's investing in a 401k these days?"
We say: t better to cut back than cut out "
 
It true. The unsteady economy is altering people's attitudes towards their employee retirement savings. Job insecurity, infrequent raises and higher food prices present a financial challenge. So how do you continue to invest? Take control in small ways. We recommend doing a personal inventory for 2 weeks to identify what you spend on hings Wee not talking about your monthly electric bill nor do we think you should give up your daily cappuccino. (We drink lots of coffee and wouldn dream of giving it up.) Here are 4 easy ways to ut backon spending so you don have to 'cut out' your employee retirement plan contributions.   read more
